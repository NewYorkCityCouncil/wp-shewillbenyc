    * [PHP](http://php.net/)
    * [MySQL](http://mysql.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)/[GitHub](https://github.com/)

### Local Installation

Only the themes and plugins are included in this repository. All WordPress core files are ignored. To run locally, clone this repository and manually install WordPress in the same directory, being careful not to overwrite any files.

### Foundation for Sites

The #SheWillBe website uses [Foundation for Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/), a responsive and accessible front-end framework. The `wp-shewillbenyc` theme is based on [andycochran/wp-foundation-sites](https://github.com/andycochran/wp-foundation-sites), a bare-bones WordPress theme built with Foundation.

When upgrading to a newer version of Foundation, make sure `wp-shewillbenyc/assets/scss/_settings.scss` uses `@import '../../bower_components/foundation-sites/scss/util/util';` not `@import 'util/util';`.

### Editing Themes

* `cd wp-shewillbenyc/`
* Run `npm install` to get `node_modules`
* Run `bower install` to get `bower_components`
* Run `gulp` to compile the CSS & JavaScript
* Run `gulp watch` to watch for changes to `.sass` and `.js` files

### Styles

* **Do not** edit the files in `wp-shewillbenyc/assets/css/`—they're generated by Gulp
* Add your custom styles to `wp-shewillbenyc/assets/scss/app.scss`
* Change the Foundation variables in `wp-shewillbenyc/assets/scss/_settings.scss`
* Choose which Foundation component to include in `wp-shewillbenyc/assets/scss/foundation.scss`

### JavaScript

* **Do not** edit the files in `wp-shewillbenyc/assets/js/`—they're generated by Gulp
* Add/edit your custom JavaScript files in `wp-shewillbenyc/assets/js/scripts/`
* All .js files in `wp-shewillbenyc/assets/js/scripts/` will concatenate to `wp-shewillbenyc/assets/js/scripts.js` and `wp-shewillbenyc/assets/js/scripts.min.js`
* Choose which Foundation JavaScript components to include in `wp-shewillbenyc/gulpfile.js`
